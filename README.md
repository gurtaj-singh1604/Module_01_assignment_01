## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

-It makes it simple to go back to previous versions
-Teamwork is improved when multiple users may work on the same project
-A project can have independent branches created by users for autonomous development
-To help with project documentation, descriptive annotations provide context and justifications for modifications.
